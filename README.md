# RoomFinder Nepal 🏠🇳🇵

RoomFinder Nepal is a mission-driven platform to help students from rural villages across Nepal — especially those coming to Kathmandu after Class 10 (SEE) and Class 12 (+2) — find affordable hostels, rooms, or rental spaces **without brokers** or hidden fees.

Many students suffer from high brokerage charges, lack of verified listings, and the overwhelming task of navigating a new city. RoomFinder Nepal is built to **solve these problems with technology** and compassion.
